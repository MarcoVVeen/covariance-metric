# Empirical Analysis of Confounding Bias in Feature Representations for Average Treatment Effect Estimation
Contains the code used for MSc. Thesis project on measuring confounding bias in feature representations.
Confounding bias in a representation measured using the formulation for confounding bias originally given by ["Deconfounding Scores: Feature Representations for Causal Effect Estimation with Weak Overlap"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05762).
